We convert categorical variables into factors for analysis
Boxplots are generated to visualize the distribution of insurance charges based on categorical variables
We build a linear regression model to predict charges based on all available predictors:

Model Interpretation
Coefficients: Show the estimated change in charges for each unit increase in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.
Standard Error: Indicates the precision of the coefficient estimates.
t-values and p-values: Help assess whether the predictor variables significantly contribute to predicting charges. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the variable is significant.
R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in charges explained by the model. Values closer to 1 suggest a better fit.
Adjusted R-squared: Adjusted for the number of predictors, providing a more accurate measure for multiple regression.
F-statistic: Tests whether at least one predictor variable has a non-zero coefficient.

Prediction Methodology
Using Variance for Predictions
The variance of the residuals (the difference between observed and predicted values) provides insight into the models accuracy. 
A smaller variance indicates a better fit, meaning that the modelâ€™s predictions are closer to the actual values. To make predictions for new customers
